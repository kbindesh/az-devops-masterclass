# Azure DevOps Interview Questions

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is Development and Operation’s Collaboration, it’s a Union of 3Ps – Process, People and Product (working Product) that enable continuous integration and continuous delivery of value to our end users. DevOps accelerate the process to deliver applications and software services at high speed and high velocity. So that organization can learn and adopt to the market at its earliest. Also, it minimizing the risk factor by continuously delivering and getting end users and stakeholders feedback at the early stages.

In Traditional software development, after completing the development part, the code deployment time was huge. And many times, we heard the common fights between the Development Team and Operations Team or deployment team that it works fine on our system, it’s the sever causing problem and operation team defenses it’s not your server it’s your code, Right? Well, DevOps solves the Traditional Dev and Ops fights by breaking the wall of confusion.

### How DevOps Works?

- DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers that work together in the entire project lifecycle, from the design and development process to production releases and support.
- Starting from design and development to testing automation and from continuous integration to continuous delivery, the team works together to achieve the desired goal.
- People having both development and operations skill sets working together and use various tools for CI-CD and Monitoring to respond quickly to customer’s need and fix issues and bugs.

### What are the benefits of DevOps?

The main benefits of implementing DevOps are:

- Customer Satisfaction
- More engaged and Collaborative Development and Operation teams
- DevOps Deploy code faster in the market through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
- Faster Operational Support
- Strong Infrastructure Performance and IT performance
- Less failures and continuous improvement
- Transparency between the team
- Constant Monitoring and better adaption
- Increase efficiency

### What are the DevOps tools?

- To Implement DevOps, Automation plays a major role and we defiantly need some tools for Implementation. Following are the major areas:
  - Planning
  - Code management
  - Build and Testing
  - Release management
  - Deploy and Monitor

### Which tools are useful for Continuous Integration?

- Azure Pipelines has support for all the platform like Linux, macOS, and Windows also we can consider following tools for the Continuous Integration.
  - Jenkins
  - Azure Pipelines
  - TeamCity
  - Travis CI
  - Bamboo
  - GitLab CI
  - CircleCI
  - Codeship

### Which tools are useful for Continuous Deployment?

- ElectricFlow
- Octopus Deploy
- AWS CodeDeploy
- DeployBot
- Shippable

### What tools are useful for cloud Infrastructure management?

Following are the most popular tools for Infrastructure management:

- Chef
- Puppet
- Ansible

### What is Continuous Testing? What is the use of Test Automation in DevOps?

- DevOps is not about jobs or tools, it's about people, culture and automation.
- To implement DevOps, continuous testing plays a very important role where writing scripts for software testing and make it auto executable so that we can automate the testing and do the frequent releases using the delivery pipelines.
- We have to write unit testing to achieve Continuous Testing.

### Which tools are useful for Continuous Monitoring?

- For continuous monitoring Nagios, SysDig and Zabbix are the famous open source tools available in the market.
- Public cloud vendors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have tools like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor and StackDriver. Also, New Relic is a good option for continuous monitoring.

### What is the container and What containers Azure DevOps support?

- The container will provide a way to package your software code, its configurations, Packages and its dependencies into a single unit or object.
- We can have multiple containers that can run on the same machine and share the operating system with other containers so that we can run anywhere fast and reliable and consistent deployments.

Azure DevOps has the following container support.

- Azure VM + Docker
- Container Apps
- Container Instances
- Azure Kubernetes services
- Azure App Services
- Azure Service Fabric application with Docker support

### Define Azure boards ?

- It is a DevOps service which is used to manage the projects of software.
- It offers various sets of abilities like dashboards, reporting, scrum and kanban.
- Its essential feature contains queries, backlogs, sprints, dashboards and work items.

### What is Azure repos ?

Azure Repos is a cloud based version control (git) system which is used for code management and various versions by using the lifecycle of the development.

- It is also used to track the changes for the code through various teams, the clear list of changes may be used for coordination between teams and collaborate the changes for future use.
- One of the essential features of it is centralized version control and distributed version control.
- Git is an example for distributed version control, TFVC is an example for centralized version control.

### Explain Azure pipelines ?

- It is One of the essential azure cloud services, with which we can build and test the projects code automatically.

- It works productively with the help of major languages and types of the project, it shares that project code with other customers also.
