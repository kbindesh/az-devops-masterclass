# Version Control with Git

## What is Version Control?

- Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
- Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
- Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
- If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
- Source Code Management (SCM) is synonymous with _Version control_.

## Benefits of version control systems

1. **Tracking history** of every file associated with your application
2. **Branching and merging**: Team members can work concurrently in different environments and on diff modules.
3. **Traceability**. Being able to trace each change made to the software and connect it to project management and bug tracking software such as _Jira_ or _Azure Boards_

## Source code management best practices

- Commit often
- Ensure you're working from latest version
- Make detailed notes
- Review changes before committing
