# Git Overview

## What is Git?

- Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today.
- Git is an open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system kernel.
- Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System).

## Why use Git for your organization?

- **Feature branch workflow**

  - One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities.
  - Git branches are cheap and easy to merge.
  - This facilitates the feature branch workflow popular with many Git users.
  - Feature branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your codebase.
  - When a developer wants to start working on something—no matter how big or small—they create a new branch.
  - This ensures that the main branch always contains production-quality code.

- **Distributed development**
  - In SVN, each developer gets a working copy that points back to a single central repository. **Git**, however, is a distributed version control system.
  - Each developer gets their own local repository, complete with a full history of commits.
- **Pull requests**
  - A pull request is a way to ask another developer to merge one of your branches into their repository.
  - This not only makes it easier for project leads to keep track of changes, but also lets developers initiate discussions around their work before integrating it with the rest of the codebase.
- **Community**
- **Faster release cycle**
